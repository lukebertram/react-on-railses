# README

An experimental project attempting to integrate a rails api to serve as a backend for a React view layer. Possibly with a GraphQL layer? Who knows.

I promise to come back here and update this file with relevant details (like setup instructions, outlines, plans, bugs, and emotional log entries).


Things I'll want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
